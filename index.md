# Workshop Description
This workshop presents the basics behind understanding and using modern machine learning algorithms. We will discuss a framework for reasoning about when to apply various machine learning techniques, emphasizing questions of over-fitting/under-fitting, interpretability, supervised/unsupervised methods, and handling of missing data. The principles behind various algorithms—the why and how of using them—will be discussed, while some mathematical detail underlying the algorithms—including proofs—will not be discussed. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms presented will include k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), tSNE, and independent component analysis (ICA). Supervised machine learning algorithms presented will include support vector machines (SVM), lasso, elastic net, classification and regression trees (CART), boosting, bagging, and random forests. Imputation, regularization, and cross-validation concepts will also be covered. The R programming language will be used for occasional examples, though participants need not have prior exposure to R.
Prerequisites: Undergraduate-level linear algebra and statistics; basic programming experience (R/Matlab/Python).

Alexander Ioannidis is an Adjunct Professor in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (CME) at Stanford. His research is in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford Medical School, where he focuses on computational methods for genomics and clinical data science with a particular focus on diverse populations, and at Galatea Bio, where he is vice president of data science. His Ph.D. is from Stanford in CME, and he also has an M.S. in Management Science & Engineering (Optimization) from Stanford. Prior to this he earned a bachelors in Chemistry and Physics from Harvard, an M.Phil in Computational Biology from the Dept. of Applied Math and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge and conducted research for several years on quantum and superconducting computing logic at Northrop Grumman.
