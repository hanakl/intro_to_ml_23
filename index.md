# Workshop Description
The interview process for technically demanding roles has been evolving rapidly
over the last few decades. In this workshop, we'll cover the fundamentals of
what you need to know to *get started* with preparing for *your* technical
interview journey (everyone's is different!).
  * The *Introductory* workshop will cover aspects of an Interview that may
be helpful as you search for **internships**, such
as:
    * What to expect when interviewing for different technical roles; i.e.
what's the difference between an MLE, a DS, and SWE?
    * How to prepare for "softball" interview questions within a technical
interview.
    * Programming questions and analysis of algorithms using Python.
    * Basic SQL
  * The *Advanced* workshop covers topics that are of interest to students who
may be preparing to graduate and get their first **job**. 
    * How does the difficulty of questions scale with the level
expectation of the role?
    * Programming questions at an intermediary level of complexity, solved using
C++.
    * Advanced SQL


_Prerequisites:_ We're targeting students who have programming experience and a background in mathematics and sciences; the workshop(s) won't cover *how* to program in Python or C++: if you want to learn more about that, see e.g. 
my [Introductory Course Notes](https://github.com/CME211/notes#contents).
We anticipate that you understand the basic data structures
and control-flow (such as List and For-loops in Python), and for the advanced
workshop we're expecting that you understand (proficiently!) the Standard Template Library in C++.

## About the Instructor

![Andreas Santucci](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}

Andreas Santucci graduated from Stanford in 2017 with a degree in Computational
and Mathematical Engineering. During his time at Stanford, Andreas did
causal-inference research with 
[Guido Imbens](https://imbens.people.stanford.edu/), who was named a Nobel
Laureate in 2021, and also aced qualifying exams in his favorite subjects
including Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms as well as Stochastic Processes.

Andreas is currently taking on multiple roles within industry and academia
simultaneously:
  * At Google, Andreas is a Data Scientist: he designs state of the art
recommendation algorithms for YouTube, and pursues cutting edge techniques for
statistical inference on sparse data, for example. He also dances the boundary between a SWE/MLE role, often implementing ideas into production himself using (distributed) C++, training models, running live-traffic experiments, etc.
  * At Stanford, Andreas is a Lecturer at [ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/): he teaches a *sequence* of
graduate-level software development courses that showcase advanced usage of
modern C++.
  * At the 
  [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/): he   serves on the
Education Committee, where the objective is to facilitate getting students
involved with STEM.

# Workshop Materials

## Pre-workshop Checklist

1. Sign up for [Piazza](https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2021/icmeinterviewworkshops) (class code *icme*). We will attempt to host a Piazza page such that you may learn *from each other* after the workshop is over. (*Note that the best time to ask Andreas questions is _during_ the Q&A sessions held at the end of each workshop session).
2. Familiarize yourself with the schedule and see you Monday, October 18th at 7:15 P.M. PST via Zoom!
3. Afterward, you can review the
